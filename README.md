# RememberIt

A tool to help you remember the stuff you search/read.

## First Cut

A chrome extension that tracks your history and looks for searches
where you have searched the meaning of a word.

It then stores the word-meaning pair as a flash card for you.

Some possibilities:
1. Sign in to your Anki web/share anki details so that the cards get synced with your anki decks. 
	Issue: This, however, would make the solution anki specific.
2. Enabling storing data on your local(so that cloud services are not required). Flash cards are stored in standard format. There is a extension landing page where you can revise all your flash cards
from your local directory. There is option to export the flash cards to different formats.
	Issue: Will have to implement the spaced repetition algorithm. Need to check on the feasability.


## Going Forward

Option to add pages as flash cards, pages will be bought up based on spaced repetition algorithm.
Aditionally, question-answer pairs can be extracted from the page to make specific flash cards for you.
